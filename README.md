A RemoteDOM implementation for ChromeCast.

## How to setup your Chromecast for RemoteDOM
To use this receiver application on your Chromecast, you have to do the following (as of October 2013):

1. Run through the [whitelisting process](https://developers.google.com/cast/whitelisting)
2. Fill out the form like this:
   # Company name: "f5839d2f-c2c5-46c9-9b5e-f2e1fe6a1ebd" (that's my developer ID)
   # What type of request: "Add more Chromecast devices to existing account"
   # Put "f5839d2f-c2c5-46c9-9b5e-f2e1fe6a1ebd" as the Developer ID
   # Put in the serial number(s) of your Chromecast device(s)
3. Wait for the confirmation email (may take a couple of days)

Afterwards, you should be able to launch the App "f5839d2f-c2c5-46c9-9b5e-f2e1fe6a1ebd" on your device.

If you encounter problems with this process, please let me know (using Github issues in this repository)
